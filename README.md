# Matrix To Latex
This static site is a linear algebra tool designed to accept matrix inputs and display copyable .tex output. \
This project was created using pure javascript, html, and css without frameworks. Mathjax library was used for LaTeX rendering. It was designed by wrapping fraction objects inside of complex number objects. \
